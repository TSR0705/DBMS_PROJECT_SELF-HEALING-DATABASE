VIVA EXAM STRUCTURE (Typical)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Time: 30-60 minutes
Format: Face-to-face technical interview

You Will Be Asked:
  Q1: "Explain your schema design. Why 8 tables?"
      → Answer: 30 seconds intro + justification (memorize from VIVA_PREP)

  Q2: "How do you prevent AI from executing actions?"
      → Answer: Point to FK constraints (action_executions.approval_id)

  Q3: "Draw the data flow diagram on the whiteboard"
      → Answer: Draw from ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md (have reference available)

  Q4: "How does ML learn without controlling execution?"
      → Answer: learning_records is read-only; no FK back to recovery_decisions

  Q5: "What's the most critical foreign key and why?"
      → Answer: action_executions.approval_id (NOT NULL) – impossible to execute unapproved

  Q6: "What if admin approves a dangerous action?"
      → Answer: Whitelist in predefined_actions prevents dangerous actions existing

  Q7: [Challenging question about your design]
      → Answer: Refer to VIVA_PREPARATION.md "If Examiner Challenges" section

You Should Be Prepared To:
  ✓ Explain each table in <1 minute
  ✓ Draw ER diagram from memory
  ✓ Write a query for "pending decisions"
  ✓ Justify data type choices (e.g., DECIMAL vs FLOAT)
  ✓ Defend normalization decisions
  ✓ Explain safety guarantees

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SUCCESS CRITERIA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After Reading This Package, You Should Be Able To:

❑ Recite all 8 table names and their purposes (30 seconds each)
❑ Explain why separation of concerns matters (1 minute)
❑ Point to specific FK constraints that prevent unsafe execution (30 seconds)
❑ Draw the complete data flow diagram (5 minutes)
❑ Explain why DECIMAL(3,2) instead of FLOAT (1 minute)
❑ Justify the normalized (3NF) design (2 minutes)
❑ Answer any of the 10 expected viva questions (1-2 minutes each)
❑ Explain the learning loop and ML boundary (2 minutes)
❑ Defend against "what if" scenarios (30 seconds per scenario)
❑ Write SQL queries for audit and validation (5 minutes)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
AFTER VIVA (Phase 2, Step 2)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Once schema is approved:

Step 2a: Stored Procedures
  - Safe execution wrappers
  - Parameter validation
  - Error handling

Step 2b: Admin Views
  - Dashboard for pending decisions
  - Metrics and effectiveness tracking
  - Approval audit trail

Step 2c: Backup & Recovery
  - Schema backup strategy
  - Transaction logs
  - Disaster recovery plan

Step 2d: ML Integration
  - Learning_records → ML model training
  - Confidence calibration feedback
  - Feature engineering

But that's future work. Focus on Phase 2, Step 1 (this schema) for now.
